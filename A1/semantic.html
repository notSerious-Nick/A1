<h4>Welcome to the Campus Coffee Guide. This site helps students find good coffee on and around campus.

<p><b>On-Campus</b></p>
<p>Two Creek has a nice outdoor area to enjoy good weather. The Starbucks in the bookstore is a good place to show off your Stanley cups.
</p>
<p><b>Off-Campus</b></p>
<p>Publik Eds is housed in a once iconic dive lunch spot. Cucina is a good place to go and wonder how people have so much time to linger over pricey lunches.
</p>
<p><b>Hours</b></p>
<p>Most campus locations are open from 8am to 6pm. Hours may vary during finals week.
